                    <p>Outdoorsy types travel far and wide to admire this breathtaking UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                        Straddling the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls is roughly twice as deep and
                        wide as Niagara Falls, making it one of the world's most impressive waterfalls. To see this
                        natural wonder at its prime, plan a visit in April when the region's rainy season has concluded.
                        Popular vantage points include the Knife-Edge Bridge, Livingstone Island and Devil's Pool. When
                        you're not enjoying the view from above, go whitewater rafting in the Zambezi River to admire
                        the falls from a different angle.</p>

                    <p>Most tourists head to Tanzania to go on safari, but you'd be remiss if you didn't save time for
                        seeing the country's other treasures. In addition to its animal-filled plains, Tanzania boasts
                        otherworldly natural wonders, including red-hued Lake Natron, Ngorongoro Conservation Area's
                        expansive crater and Mount Kilimanjaro – the tallest mountain in Africa (and largest
                        free-standing mountain on Earth). For the ultimate adrenaline rush, book a climbing excursion up
                        the continent's famous mountain through a local tour operator..</p>

                        unforgettable adventure. After trekking to this Indian Ocean archipelago off of Africa's eastern
                        coast, you'll instantly feel at ease as you lounge on quiet beaches like Matemwe and Pongwe.
                        Next, visit Zanzibar City's UNESCO World Heritage-listed Stone Town, where you'll find the ruins
                        of a 19th-century palace and a graveyard with ties to Zanzibar's former Arab royals. And no trip
                        would be complete without taking a spice tour in the countryside and exploring Jozani-Chwaka Bay
                        National Park.</p>

                        With millions upon millions of residents to its name, Tokyo features flashing lights and crowded
                        streets that novice visitors may have a hard time keeping up with. Visit Odaiba – a mini island

                        boats and limestone rock formations that rise from the sea. Relaxing on the beach, swimming in
                        the water and enjoying boat tours are the most popular things to do here, as is visiting the
                        towering Big Buddha statue. What's more, travelers can find relatively affordable lodging
