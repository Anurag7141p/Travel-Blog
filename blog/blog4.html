                <p>It’s not a surprise that I often think back to my recent trip to Jamaica. <br><br>

                    Whether it’s the flashes of white sand and perfect water, the local food, the wanders through
                    downtown Montego Bay, the day trips into the jungle-covered interior and, of course, the infectious
                    vibe of the people, the trip was beyond memorable. <br><br>

                    I had been to Jamaica many times when I worked on board cruise ships as a Tour Manager, way back in
                    the early 2000s. But this time was different. Instead of visiting for a mere few hours at a time, on
                    this occasion, it was a full 10 days on the island. Naturally, this gifted me the opportunity to do
                    more, meet more people, eat more food and simply visit far more places. <br><br>

                    A vacation to Jamaica should be high up, very high up, on any traveler’s list, especially if that
                    traveler is fond of tropical destinations, a combination of relaxation and culturally-focused
                    excursions, endless natural wonders and, to be honest, feeling happy from the moment you arrive.
                    From that first smile and all the positive energy you’ll soak up from your first few conversations,
                    by the time you reach your accommodation you will already know that you’ve made the right choice for
                    your trip. <br><br>

                    And the good news is that traveling to Jamaica right now is quite easy, with a simple set of Covid
                    guidelines to follow:<br>

                <p>
                    As for my personal recommendations of places to visit: <br><br>

                   - Beaches (Negril Seven Mile Beach is gorgeous!) <br>
                   - Dunn’s River Falls <br>
                   - Bob Marley Museum <br>
                   - Wandering around downtown Montego Bay <br>
                   - Appleton Rum Tour<br>
                   - Food tasting (find out where the locals eat and try jerk chicken, codfish and meat patties)<br>
                   - Hire a driver for a day trip through the interior (stop in villages along the way and meet great
                    people!) <br><br>
                    Jamaica is also a short flight from much of the US, making it an even more ideal destination for
                    that well-deserved island vacation. <br><br>

                    I’ll be back again myself, for sure. And it will absolutely be for another 10 day stay (at least!)
                    as I still have plenty more of this welcoming, laid-back island to explore! <br><br>
