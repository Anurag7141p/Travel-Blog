                <p>There’s no escaping the fact that everything is getting more expensive. With the increased cost of
                    living, you may be looking for ways to reduce how much you spend on your upcoming trip to Germany.

                    To help out, I’ve come up with a few suggestions to keep costs to a minimum. Although this post is
                    about visiting Germany on a budget, the tips can be applied to just about any popular travel
                    destination.

                    There are some costs you can’t avoid when traveling, like the price of a visa or travel
                    authorization. The good news is that, if you’re from a visa-exempt country such as the US, you don’t
                    need a visa to travel to Germany for up to 90 days. The new travel authorization for Germany, ETIAS,
                    won’t be operational until 2023 so you don’t need to pay these fees either just yet.

                    Most other travel costs, however, are under your control. Let’s have a look at some of the top tips
                    for visiting Germany on a budget. </p>
                <h2>Eat at the Markets</h2>
                <p>The food you’ll find at German markets is both fresh and reasonably priced. It’s also often organic,
                    so you know that what you’re eating is good for you! You’ll find traditional German foods like
                    bratwurst, potato pancakes, and pretzels. You can also try something new—there are often vendors
                    selling international cuisine at the markets. <br>If you have access to a kitchen, you can shop for
                    local ingredients and cook up your own delish dishes without spending a fortune.</p>
                <h2>Stay Outside of Major Tourist Areas</h2>
                <p>Staying in a hotel or hostel outside of the major tourist areas is one of the easiest ways to save
                    money while traveling. And, since all of Germany’s major cities are relatively safe, it’s not like
                    you need to worry about your safety. There are plenty of options for accommodation in every price
                    range and style preference. <br>Avoiding the most touristy areas is a great way to reduce your
                    accommodation costs. Just make sure it’s not so far out that you’ll end up spending too much on
                    transportation. Go for hotels and hostels that are within around 30 minutes walk of the main
                    attractions and well connected by public transport to other areas.

                </p>
                <h2>Find an Apartment to Rent Online</h2>
                <p>If you are unfamiliar with the city you are visiting, Airbnb is a great option for accommodation. In
                    addition to having access to the amenities of a hotel (like a kitchen and washing machine), many
                    hosts have been known to act as tour guides and offer suggestions on where to go out in town or what
                    attractions are worth visiting. <br>There are many other websites that can help you find apartments
                    for short-term rent in Germany. Wimdu offers properties ranging from apartments and chalets to
                    farmhouses and tree houses throughout Germany—though some listings may require booking several weeks
                    in advance if they’re popular during high season. The site includes vacation rentals from more
                    cities across Europe including Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, and Frankfurt. </p>
                <h2>Use Public Transportation</h2>
                <p>Public transportation is a great way to get around in Germany. If you’re planning on visiting Berlin,
                    the U-Bahn and S-Bahn are your best bets for getting around. They’ll take you from one part of the
                    city to another quickly and easily—and it’s much cheaper than taking cabs every time!</p>
                <h2>Buy Your Plane Ticket Early</h2>
                <p>Booking early is important when looking for cheap flights to Germany. In general, the earlier you
                    book, the more likely it is that you can get a good deal on your ticket. <br>

                    Use flight price comparison websites to find the best option. Several low-cost airlines fly to
                    cities across Germany. If you’re traveling within Europe, you can find cheap flights to Germany from
                    just about any European city. <br>

                    Also, think about when you’re going to travel. The price of your flight to Germany will depend on
                    the time of year, if you don’t mind the cold, January could be a cheap month to travel to Germany.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h2>Visit Museums on Discounted Days</h2>
                <p>You may also be able to save money on museum tickets on discounted days. Many museums in Germany
                    offer a reduced price for certain days of the week, as well as reduced admission for senior citizens
                    and students. You can check the website of each museum you want to visit for a list of discounted
                    days and special offers. <br>

                    Finally, if you’re staying in hostels or hotels while traveling around Germany, ask them if they
                    have any deals that will help reduce your costs while visiting museums. <br>

                </p>
                <h2>Go on Free Walking Tours</h2>
                <p>Ok, so they may be called free walking tours but the truth is you’ll be expected to pay your guide a
                    well-earned tip. Nevertheless, this is a really cost-effective way to get to known German cities.
                    <br>

                    Walking tours take you to all the major attractions and monuments. During a walking tour of Berlin,
                    you’re likely to see Red Town Hall, Berlin Cathedral, Checkpoint Charlie, and the Brandenburg Gate,
                    among other highlights</p>
